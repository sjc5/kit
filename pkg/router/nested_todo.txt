validation on registration -- make sure patterns and trie as a whole are good



ability to mount your nested router on your normal router?  like, put down your normal routes, and then mount your nested at "/*"?



// __TODO warn of circular deps
// __TODO build entire deps tree at initialization time

input validation ?  maybe like a whole init step to convert r into ctx.Input ?

middlewares / procedures?  they can just be deps maybe??
